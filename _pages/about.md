I am a graduate student majored in Electrical Engineering at Stanford. I received my B.S in Electrical Engineering (2018) from Tsinghua University.

My undergraduate research advisor was Tianling Ren. I was a visiting student under the guidance of Chenming Hu and Sayeef Salahuddin at UC Berkeley in summer 2017. In Spring 2018, I did research under the guidance of Kang L. Wang at UCLA. During my Stanford life, my advisor is Krishna Saraswat.
