### Research Assistant to Kang L. Wang
* Simulated half-integer quantized conductance plateaus in the system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with superconductor, which is the signature of the Majorana fermion modes

## Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, UC Berkeley
>
### Research Assistant to Chenming Hu & Sayeef Salahuddin
* Investigated the design space of hysteresis-free negative capacitance FETs by performing a cross-architecture analysis using different ferroelectric materials integrated on bulk MOSFET, fully depleted SOI-FETs and sub-10nm FINFETs with TCAD Sentaurus simulation
* Devised a new method by which to simulate cylindrical ferroelectric material via a combination of Gaussâ€™ Law and Landau Equation, so as to explore the characteristics of Negative Capacitance Nanowire FETs
