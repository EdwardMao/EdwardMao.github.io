title: "A ferroelectric thin film transistor based on annealing-free HfZrO film"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper2
excerpt: 'A ferroelectric thin film transistor (Fe-TFT) based on annealing-free hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO) is demonstrated in this paper. Indium zinc oxide was used as channel semiconductor. The as-deposited 30-nm HfZrO film implemented as gate dielectric was proved to be crystallized with a mixture of monoclinic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic phases and showed ferroelectricity naturally. Thus, high temperature annealing process was avoided. The transfer characteristic of this Fe-TFT was demonstrated with operating voltage that was smaller than 3 V, memory window about 1 V, and small subthreshold slope (SS) about 82 mV/dec. The charge trapping phenomenon in this device was explored by characterizing the transfer curves with different ranges of gate voltages. This HfZrO-based device with low processing thermal budget and small SS has high potential for Fe-TFT memory which can be used in oxide semiconductor-based systems and applications.'
