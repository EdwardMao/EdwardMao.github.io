title: "Synaptic computation demonstrated in a two-synapse network based on top-gate electric-double-layer synaptic transistors"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper3
excerpt: 'In this letter, a two-synapse network with synaptic computation function is demonstrated. Solid-state electric-double-layer indium-zinc oxide-based synaptic transistors gated by silicon oxide electrolyte are used as artificial synapses. The short-term synaptic plasticity of the synaptic transistors is utilized to achieve high-frequency filter, processing frequency coding spike stimulus. The filtering characteristics of one synapse are controlled by the other one. Furthermore, we conducted synaptic computation in the two-synapse network, which demonstrates how synaptic transistors perform computational functions in neural networks.'
