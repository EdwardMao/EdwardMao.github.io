title: "Bunny World Game"
excerpt: 'Implement Bidirectional Attention Flow (BiDAF) as baseline model for Question Answering System and make adjustments to modeling layers to increase the performance (61.5%F1, 57.9%EM) based on Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).
Fine tune Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) on SQuAD2.0, apply ensemble methods to amplify versatility in reducing training variance and achieve better performance (78.8%F1, 76.0%EM).'
