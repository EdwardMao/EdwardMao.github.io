title: "3D Snake Game"
excerpt: 'For this project, we are going to construct a 3D virtual reality (VR) snake game using Unity and VRduino. Snake is a video game concept where a player controls a line-style snake which grows in length, with the wall and snake itself being the primary obstacle. To improve user experience, several concepts are included in our game, including snake perspective, four innovative blocks, snake velocity and so on. Inputs, such as keyboard inputs and head movement, are also studied in this project.'
